    "This differs from our *character-level* approach.<br>\n",
    "**We intend to keep our work character-level, but model our MLP just the same.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper assigns a $30$-dimensional feature vector to each input word.<br>\n",
    "A field $i$ in this vector does **not** correspond to the alphabetical index of the letter at position $i$ in the word. More on that later.<br>\n",
    "In fact, the paper inputs each word itself. A lookup table for the letter indices is responsible for the conversion. The lookup table is $17,000\\times 30$ in size. Each word (not character, but word) is an index in this table, which points to a unique $30$-dimensional vector.<br>\n",

    "> Example input: \"A dog was running in a [...]\"\n",

    "Let's say we have three words embedded into three $30$-dimensional vectors.<br>\n",
    "The resulting concatenation of these vectors forms the input for a fully-connected layer, activated by `tanh`, which can be chosen arbitrarily wide.<br>\n",
    "(It is logically decoupled from the amount of words in the input in its own width)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then follows another layer of the fixed width of $17,000$, where `softmax` is applied.<br>Softmax normalizes the outputs to partial probabilities over the set of possible words. In the end, the neuron with the highest assigned probability is chosen.<br>(And backprop is then performed, if training is running). This neuron represents an index for one of the $17,000$ trained words, the word to come next.\n",
